## Features

One of the main reasons I made this game was to explore multiplayer netcode.

Spring Dynasty is built with a server-client model with an authoritative server. Multiple devices from different locations can connect to the server if port-forwarding is enabled on the server's machine.

Some cool features that I implemented include the following:

- Client-side prediction
- Rollback netcode
